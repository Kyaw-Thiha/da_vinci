// MVP Definition
- investors want to see that it works and what they're paying money
  for can be implemented. Our minimum product should be sellable
  MVP - what it's value lies in
- 'Backend'
    - application designs a unique pathway based on user input
      (how long they're away for, adjacent nodes,number of caretakers available (maybe hard code the last one))
    - able to work with unique maps and layouts, hence will be able to take in and generate pathways for different maps
- 'Frontend'
    - user able to properly scan the QR code
    - input time which
    - send data to the database (if there's time)
    - look up their NFTs
    - claim their NTFs (some kind of UI effect to show it has been claimed and grey it out)
  value:
      - optimizes the cleaning process for the caretakers reducing costs (more optimized -> more efficient),
        # of caretakers that need to be hired (bc human resource is one of the most expensive costs for the hotel)
        provides sustainable solutions
      - can be integrated in any hotel
      - hotels can themselves decide what they offer as rewards
      - NFT reward system - cannot be abused / hacked
      - encourage customers to give feedback to the system, ensuring that it runs
      - not only that - motivates people to stay for longer / go back to the hotel, increasing the revenue in the long run



// TODO

> Time input screen
      > integrate with the QR code functionality
      > library to compute UTC time
      > routing to send time to the backend
      > decide where the backend is hosted / where to send information
> Assets / Check Rewards page
      > buttons to redeem - inputs info into database
> integrate with backend
> Backend page
      > get hotel map input (future feature)
      > get input for the # of caretakers
      > generate arrows for caretakers based on the user input
      > add a third hallway + more rooms
> make sure Frontend works on phone

// DONE
> Time input screen
      > button to direct to the next page (routing)
      > fix the header of the webpage
      > API to enter time
      > checkmark animation
>Assets / Check Rewards page
      > list NFTs (cards)
> Backend Page
      > map layout - visual


> algorithm is dynamic
> pathfinding takes in info about the rooms
> hardcoding the layout of the hotel
> send room id and duration / time
> will change the status to 'to be cleaned'
> another feature for the slides : caretakers update the cleaned status of the rooms of their side which updates the
  map in real time
> need a demo video
